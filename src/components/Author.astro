          More than ten years ago, I started my career as a software engineer. I
          worked in small companies. I worked in big companies. I traveled the
          world, spoke in more than 110 conferences, and met thousands of
          developers.
        </p><p class="mb-4">
          I never wanted to write a book, but I realized that being a developer
          is more than knowing the hottest tools. Because of that, I decided to
          reach out to the best developers I know and ask them tips on how to be
          more productive.
        </p><p class="mb-4">
          This book is a collection of valuable learnings not only from me but
          from experienced programmers from all over the world.
